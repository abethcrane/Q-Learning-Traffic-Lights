	    -added dual lanes - basically only needed to modify the 'car.update velocity'
	    code to correctly sense it was approaching a traffic light, add some new road
	    entrances and our forethought in programming handled the rest.
	    -adding amber was very tricky because the fact that a switch was a delayed
	    action meant that the program couldn't 'learn' the results for several moves
	    down the track. required quite a bit of rearranging of the main logic
	Query: whoever made the substantial changes to Main and 
	interfaces - can you explain what you've done? I... hope
	everything still works. Though a brief inspection of the output
	indicates its learning quite well.
	    Also, can we take stateCode out of RoadMap? The value thus
	computed is basically useless to everything except
	LearnerModuleImpl.
	
        -I made the substantial changes, it was necessary because of the way I had to 
        do amber lights, see brief description above
        - by all means move it into learnermoduleimpl

	        query: "base method" being a method of Object/whatever else
	    that might be extended?
	    -Base method being the method in the interface that is actually called.
	    Our program should never be calling a method of an impl class, it should
	    be calling a method of eg RoadMap, which then redirects to the method in
	    whichever class that particular instance is

	* Main.java: started cleaning up some duplicated code. However
	             the only reason I actually submitted this modified
	             version is I accidently deleted the old one; so by
	             all means overwrite it in case of a conflict.

	* Viewer.java: pretty colors

	* Viewer.java: exists. provides graphical output functionality.
	* Main.java: uses this functionality.
	* interfaces/RoadMap.java: features `boolean roadAt(Coords)'
	* RoadMapImpl.java: implements this.

	@Nathan: 
	    re: gridSize: is it actually an interior field? you'd need
	    to know it if you ever want to say a traffic light is on a 
	    map; eg, Main.java:41. you could have a getter for a private
	    final int if you like, though i don't see what is to be
	    gained there.
	        the other possibilty is if we wanted the map size to be
	    either undefined or expandable (more probably the latter
	    given how we've currently decided to represent it). in that
	    case it could be useful having RoadMap give you a list of 
	    intersections? you'd also need a way of predicting the
	    effect of addCars, since RoadMap assumes it gets coordinates
	    {0<=x<40, 0<=y<40}.
	        i'll probably add the list of intersections when
	    graphics are done; any thoughts on addCars? also, any
	    thoughts on having not-necessarily-straight Roads?

	    re: overrides: another thing they convey is that they
	    override something. happy to leave them, as apparently
	    everyone does this. (aside: i can't help but be concerned
	    this is only the world doing what its IDE tells it to. and
	    not just with override)
	        query: "base method" being a method of Object/whatever
	    else that might be extended?

	* CarImpl.java: summarised our discussion, leaving code in the 
	                "counterintuitive" form; it works and we understand
	                it.

responding to changes below:
	- gave up adding "??" comments every time I saw an @Override
	  that didn't appear to override anything
	    -clarifying - @Override is placed there when I automatically generate these methods from the interface. (I can hit alt enter and my IDE creates them for me)
	                  You are correct, they are unnecessary in most cases, but my IDE places them there regardless, and it was easier for me to just leave them
	                  When I worked at atlassian this was also common practice because they do no harm and they do help convey that this method is not the base method.
	                  I believe (might be wrong) that doing this also helps to link this method to the base method in the interface for javadoc purposes (i know we arent
	                  doing javadocs but old habits die hard)
    - changed gridSize to be public final
        - why? I have always been taught that interior fields should not, as a rule, be made available publicly
    	    except through getters and setters
	- suggested renaming `removeIfOffRoad' but then did nothing
	  about it
	    - I have renamed this to 'hasLeftMap' - hopefully connotates the intention of the method a bit better

	* Action.java: now exists

	* TrafficLight.java: added method `clock'

	* Main.java: adheres to the updated TrafficLight and 
	             LearnerModule interfaces.

	* LearningModule.java: started merging aforementioned code from 
	                       beth's TrafficLight into LearningModule.
	                       not finished so the new code is commented.

	* .: clarification: from the first bit of code I read I 
	     concluded that for loops are written "for (T t : C)\n{". 

	* ChangeLog: now exists.

	* CarImpl.java:
	- changed position, velocity and direction to be private
	- removed the restriction that direction is 1 or -1
	- in function `updateVelocity':
	    - highlighted a quirk regarding 'horizontal' and
	      'vertical' but then did nothing about it
	    - reformatted so it fits on my screen
	    - changed the commentary somewhat
	- renamed `getPosition' to `getCoords' to be consistent with
	  class `TrafficLight'
	- suggested renaming `removeIfOffRoad' but then did nothing
	  about it

	* RoadMapImpl.java:
	- changed gridSize to be public final
	- defined private final char carChar = 'C'
	- added a defaultEntrances array
	    - modified code throughout file to use this 
	      appropriately
	- in function `print':
	    - reformatted so it fits on my screen
	    - changed bottom for loop to be consistent with the rest of
	      the project
	- minor reformatting to `addCars' and `nextNonCarSquare...'
	- gave up adding "??" comments every time I saw an @Override
	  that didn't appear to override anything

	* Main.java:
	- formatting
	- reformatted some things
	- adjusted the layout of function `main'

	* LearningModule.java: now features a `learn' method which 
	should be called after the effects of `updateTrafficLights' 
	have been implemented. Changed signature of 
	`updateTrafficLights'.
